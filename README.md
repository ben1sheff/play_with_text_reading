# play_with_text_reading
a little repo for playing with automatically reading and clicking on text

To use this repo, you should be good setting up an environment with the packages in requirements.txt. I installed them all via conda, and haven't verified whether this has issues with pip

To use no_log_out as a script to avoid logging out or falling asleep, an example for usage is in the last cell of notebook_click_text, the main function is NoLogOut.run, so checking the documentation there may also be helpful.
